# What does this resource provide?

- Ability to rob Fleeca banks across the map
- Ability to upgrade bank security levels, lowering vault access duration the higher the level

# Why is there no middle table loot or cash trolleys like other bank heist resources?

Fleeca are small banks, with small holdings. The table in the middle would typically be used to stand stuff on when opening your own safety deposit box NOT for storing piles or trolleys of cash

# Why aren't you using [marked_bills] for your currency of dirty money?

Because we don't like them. We prefer the use of the dirty money item

# DRILLING MINIGAME REQUIREMENTS

https://github.com/meta-hub/fivem-drilling?tab=readme-ov-file

https://github.com/meta-hub/meta_libs/releases

Both of these are required for the mini game to work - If you'd rather stick with the progressbar then uncomment the progress bar code block from the client/client file and re-comment out the drilling block
